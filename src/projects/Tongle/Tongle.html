    During Workshop #1 number we did mostly exploratory activities.

    During these activities we collected sticky notes and wrote down notes on conversations we had and overhead between
    are participants. Afterwards we coded our notes into sticky note like ideas and user our participant generated
    sticky notes and our own to affinity board.

  <h3>A Survey to Validate Our Assumption</h3>

      <p className="content-exp">
        After affinity diagramming we noticed that our groups formed themes or articulated values. Upon reflection we
        decided that the best thing to do here would be to use our groups to create values that were selected.
      </p>

    </div>
    The survey allows users to rate each value on a 7 point Likert scale and optinaly provide an explanation to their
    rating.

<h3>Insights from workshop #1</h3>
<ul>
  <li>There is a divide between what urban and rural drivers need in a RUC</li>
  <li>There is a preference for keeping the tech in a RUC as low as possible</li>
</ul>
<h3>Insights from workshop #1</h3>
<ul>
  <li>PD is a great process for identifying edge cases in a design (where a design "breaks")</li>
  <li>Participants are great at ideating but need leadership from designers to do it in a focused manner</li>
</ul>

      #2 consisted of presenting our values and seeing where users might go with the idea.
      <ul>
        <li>Presentation of Participants Value Evaluation.</li>
        <li>Storyboard Evaluations ~ We presented several storyboards illustrating the possible RUC solutions.</li>
        <li><a className="text-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFiETj2Wkl8">User-Centered Design Sprint</a>

    <h3>Presenting Participants Response's to Survey</h3>
    <p className="content-exp">
      In order to add a level of
      we evaluated the results by averaging likert scores. We didnâ€™t have a base metric for inclusion but noticed that
      there were 6 values that were clearly important to all participants. We choose to move forward with these

        <h3>Something Unexpected</h3>
        <p className="content-exp">
          After presenting the values to participants an interesting thing happens people started putting values at
          opposite ends and using them as tensions. Something even more interesting happened when a participant said the
          following.

      "There is no way you can have both Privacy and Accuracy. You can have one or the other but you can't have both!
      Ok??"
    </p>
    <h3>Wait, really?</h3>
    <p className="content-exp">
      I was actually the one to overhear the conversation. At the time, I was mostly just happy that our participants
      were enjoying the workshop. Later I realized, maybe this was the key. Maybe the solution is not to give one or the
      other values but to provide ways for different values to come out at different times.
    </p>

  <h3>Design insights from workshop #2</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Participants think of the values in a RUC as opposing traits that can be balanced back and forth</li>
    <li>A mobile phone app carry a stigma of monitoring and security risks</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>PD insights from workshop #2</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Transperency in the PD process gives participants a feeling of comfort</li>

    <h2>Workshop #3</h2>
    <div className="content-exp">
      Coming into #3 we needed to make massive action.
      <ul>
        <li>Attitudinal A/B tests ~ We had participants circle around the room and compare an A and a B design.</li>
        <li>RUC Court ~ We presented 4 medium fidelity prototypes and asked participants to evaluate them and then vote.
        </li>
        <li>Three Wishes</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>RUC Court prototypes</h3>
      The major part of #3 was the RUC court. In it we presented 4 different prototypes for a RUC charge.
